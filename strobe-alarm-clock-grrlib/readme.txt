This is strobe alarm clock based on wiistrobe and alarmii, but I coded this whole thing from scratch! 
I basically put alarmii and wiistrobe together. I wanted to have some nice alarm clock that will
flash my screen and shake/rumble my wiimote.  It is useful app for deaf wii owners. 
you need homebrew channel installed.  

you only need to copy apps folder to your root of sd card. 
or copy strobe-alarm-clock folder to your apps folder on your sd card.  


video of the app in action:

btw the source code is included. 

I also provide nice bitmap font creator to make your own fonts.  
you need to convert bmp to 24-bit png
